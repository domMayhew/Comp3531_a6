# New Feature

This document represents the development of a new feature by an individual developer. Once work on the feature is complete, the developer will create a pull request and have the feature merged into the main codebase.

An example would be that this feature allows users to specify their preferred styles of cuisine, like "Mediteranian" or "Vegetarian".
